This repository is made with [![IntelliJ IDEA](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJIDEA-000000.svg?logo=intellij-idea&logoColor=white)](#) with **Eclipse** hotkeys. This is why it will include configuration files which are related to this IDE this approach, and it will be favored for now, also the compiled classed for explanatory experiments. ⚙️
